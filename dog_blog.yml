      Miles is half german shepherd half who knows? He came to us from the Humaine Society of Tampa.
      He is about 4 years old. He likes to chase bikes, and cats although he is afraid of our cat, 
      Bella.

      Maggie is probably about 3 years old. She is a rescue, but an unofficial one. Her owner didn't want
      her anymore and gave her to us. She is half Basenji, and half staffordshire bull terrier. Basenjis
      are from Africa and are an ancient breed. They don't bark. Maggie can bark but it sounds ridiculous.
      She also makes a weird happy sound that sounds kind of like Yoda. She is a real cuddler and if you're
      on the couch then she wants to lay on you.
